# o--Indosluch.EM--o
New pisibi and circuit for EM-sniffer, inspired by LOM's Elektrosluch (Error Static Zapper too), SOMA Ether, 1010 Detektor and Franzis' Bat-Detector and many others...

## LOM's Elektrosluch (open Source)

Based on a single chip dual channel bi-polar Audio Operational Amplifier, opa1612, can be replaced by cheaper more noisier TL074  (suchas the Error Zapper). Runs on 9V.

## ERROR Zapper

Seems to be a clone, cheaper version of the Elektrosluch. No credits given :-(

## SOMA Ether (everything is waves)

Based on a fist stage transistor amplification, and some kinda extra antenna on the board for higher frequency bands and a potentiomter for atenuation. Second stage with SSM2211 audio amplifier. Runs on 3V.

## 1010 Detektor by Martin Howse (open Source)

Based on AD8313 HF-detektor (kinda expensive) and fist stage amplification with LM358, second LM386.

## Elektronik-Labor |  Bat-Detector (open Source) in german

Based on a first stage single transistor amplification, and a radio AM/FM chip CD2003 for high-frequency demodulation, frequency is adjusted with 555 timer. Final amplification stage with LM386.
